# FastTracker

Tools: jQuery, Ajax, C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, nUnit, Microsoft SQL Studio

FastTracker is a Job application tracker program built using ASP.NET Core MVC which has easy-to-use functionality as opposed to using Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets. Users can add, sort, update, and delete their jobs with the click of one button as opposed to changing multiple cells. These jobs are saved to an SQL database, which prevents the data from being deleted after the program is terminated.
